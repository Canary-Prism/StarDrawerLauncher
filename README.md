# StarDrawerLauncher

hehe this thing is so ugly and overengineered

this thing launches and auto-updates [StarDrawer](https://github.com/Canary-Prism/StarDrawer) (my other thing)

it downloads the latest release of StarDrawer on first launch  
each time it launches after that it checks github for the latest release  
and if there's a new one it downloads it 

NOTE: you must close and reopen the launcher to use newly downloaded versions as it checks for new versions after launching the current one  
this is done to minimise waiting time

it also saves window position and star sides when you close StarDrawer and restores it on next launch

### [Download](https://github.com/Canary-Prism/StarDrawerLauncher/releases/)

I'm assuming you know how to use GitHub. If not then here:

### Download Steps

1. Click above link
2. Find latest release
3. Find "Assets" Section
4. Click the "StardrawerLauncher-x.y.z.jar" file

### Notice

This program uses Java 22 bc i'm weird like that
