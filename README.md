# StarDrawerLauncher

hehe this thing is so ugly and overengineered

this thing launches and auto-updates [StarDrawer](https://github.com/Canary-Prism/StarDrawer) (my other thing)

### [Download](https://github.com/Canary-Prism/StarDrawerLauncher/releases/)

I'm assuming you know how to use GitHub. If not then here:

### Download Steps

1. Click above link
2. Find latest release
3. Find "Assets" Section
4. Click the "StardrawerLauncher-x.y.z.jar" file

### Notice

This program uses Java 22 bc i'm weird like that

#### [Here's a handy link](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=22)

(it's for Temurin bc nobody likes oracle)
